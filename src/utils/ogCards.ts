 * Open Graph card routing (frontend side of the build-time OG generator).

 * `dist/og/<slug>.png`. This module is the FRONTEND counterpart: it tells `SEO.tsx`
 * which routes have a generated card and what URL to point `og:image` / `twitter:image`
 * at. The two must agree on the route set and the slug rule — a drift test
 * (`ogCards.test.ts`) parses the generator and asserts they stay in sync, so a card
 * can't be generated without a reference (orphan) or referenced without being
 * generated (broken image).
 *
 * Routes WITHOUT a card (e.g. dynamic blog posts, which supply their own image)
 * fall back to the shared `/og.png`.
