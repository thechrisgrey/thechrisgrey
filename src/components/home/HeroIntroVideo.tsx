/**
 * Full-bleed animated brand intro for the home hero. It plays once and rests on
 * the fully assembled wordmark.
 *
 * Sound: browsers block gesture-free autoplay WITH audio, so the clip autoplays
 * muted and unmutes on the visitor's first interaction (click / key / touch /
 * wheel-scroll) — the earliest moment audio is permitted. That listener is
 * one-shot and self-removing.
 *
 * When motion is disabled (prefers-reduced-motion or the prerender crawl) it
 * renders the assembled frame as a static image instead — the same end state,
 * without animation, and a stable DOM for crawlers.
 *
 * Playback is driven purely by the muted + inline autoplay attributes (no
 * imperative play(), which under React StrictMode's double-invoked effects
 * rejected with a transient AbortError and intermittently swapped in the
 * poster). The media is decorative — identity is carried by the sibling sr-only
 * <h1> — so it is aria-hidden.
