**Group A (content & marketing pages) reviewed 2026-06-15** — 61 verified refinements via parallel review + adversarial verification.

### 1. Home
- [x] **[Accessibility]** Heading outline skips h1→h3 with the lone h2 out of order — sr-only h1, then 8× `as="h3"` keyPoints, then the CTA h2; primary content has no parent h2. Demote keyPoints to h2 or add a visually-hidden section h2 (`SplitReveal` `as` union needs `'h2'`). Impact: Medium. Effort: Low. (`src/pages/Home.tsx:57-66`, `src/components/SplitReveal.tsx:14`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-E…J)**
- [x] **[Performance]** Below-the-fold profile image eager-loads and competes with the LCP hero — add `loading="lazy" decoding="async"`. Impact: Medium. Effort: Low. (`src/pages/Home.tsx:158-163`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-D)**
- [x] **[Cleaner code]** Dead conditional branch — the `point.link` ternary's `<div>` fallback is unreachable (every keyPoint has a link). Impact: Low. Effort: Low. (`src/pages/Home.tsx:89-93`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-E…J)**
- [x] **[Architecture]** Static `keyPoints` array and `renderTab` are reconstructed on every render — hoist `keyPoints` to module scope. Impact: Low. Effort: Low. (`src/pages/Home.tsx:30-41`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-E…J)**
- [x] **[Consistency]** keyPoint tabs keyed by array index while sibling lists key by content. Impact: Low. Effort: Low. (`src/pages/Home.tsx:84`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-E…J)**
- [x] **[Cleaner code]** Hero shader comment documents the wrong navy hex (`// #1A2332` vs actual `#2E4A6B`). Impact: Low. Effort: Low. (`src/components/home/heroShader.ts:32`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-E…J)**

### 2. About / Personal Biography
- [x] **[Consistency]** "Altivum Inc." and "Beyond the Assessment" are plain text — wrap in `ViewTransitionLink` to `/altivum` and `/beyond-the-assessment`. Impact: Medium. Effort: Low. (`src/pages/About.tsx:52-53,74,83-84`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-E…J)**
- [x] **[Performance]** Hero signature image has no width/height/aspect-ratio (CLS risk) — add `width={1500} height={1500}`. Impact: Low. Effort: Low. (`src/pages/About.tsx:34-39`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-D)**
- [ ] **[Performance]** 1500×1500 hero PNG ships full-res for a ≤768px box (mostly-transparent canvas) — pre-resize/crop the asset. Impact: Low. Effort: Low. (`src/pages/About.tsx:34-39`) — added 2026-06-15
- [x] **[Cleaner code]** Italic via inline `style={{ fontStyle: 'italic' }}` instead of the Tailwind `italic` class used everywhere else. Impact: Low. Effort: Low. (`src/pages/About.tsx:74`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-E…J)**
- [x] **[Accessibility]** Hero image alt ("My Personal Biography") duplicates the sr-only h1 and misses the mark's text — tighten or set `alt=""`. Impact: Low. Effort: Low. (`src/pages/About.tsx:36,48`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-E…J)**

### 3. Altivum Inc
- [x] **[Consistency]** CTAs/external links drop the standard button recipe (`min-h-[48px] touch-manipulation active:scale-[0.98]`, gold glow) that Foundation uses. Impact: Medium. Effort: Low. (`src/pages/Altivum.tsx:408-421`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-E…J)**
- [x] **[Consistency]** Branch cards & HQ node bypass `typography.ts` with raw `text-*`/`leading-*` utilities. Impact: Medium. Effort: Low. (`src/pages/Altivum.tsx:255-309`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-E…J)**
- [x] **[Cleaner code]** Each `timelineItems` entry defines an `icon` SVG that is never rendered — render it or drop the field. Impact: Medium. Effort: Low. (`src/pages/Altivum.tsx:13-17,344-362`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-E…J)**
- [x] **[Cleaner code]** The three "Imperatives" are authored verbatim twice (timeline + Mission) — hoist to one array (cf. Foundation `FOCUS_AREAS`). Impact: Medium. Effort: Low. (`src/pages/Altivum.tsx:52-71,383-396`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-E…J)**
- [x] **[UI]** Hero badges positioned with magic `bottom-50` (200px) — can crowd the logo on short viewports; use an intentional corner offset. Impact: Low. Effort: Low. (`src/pages/Altivum.tsx:215,228`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-E…J)**
- [x] **[Performance]** LCP hero logo has no width/height (verifier scoped to hero only; AWS logo & full-screen image already reserve boxes). Impact: Low. Effort: Low. (`src/pages/Altivum.tsx:203-208`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-D)**
- [x] **[Accessibility]** Chamber-recognition anchor needs an `aria-label` with new-tab/destination context (decorative-SVG portion mostly moot). Impact: Low. Effort: Low. (`src/pages/Altivum.tsx:224-232`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-E…J)**

### 4. The Altivum Foundation
- [x] **[Consistency]** Cybersecurity is a 4th funded field (grid + FAQ + schema) but dropped from H1, meta description, keywords, and Vision copy — align the crawlable/snippet copy to the four-field model. Impact: High. Effort: Low. (`src/pages/Foundation.tsx:64,35-36,103`; `src/utils/schemas.ts:531,561`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-B; also aligned the JSON-LD `description` at schemas.ts:551)**
- [x] **[Performance]** Hero LCP JPEG ships 175 KB un-re-encoded with no WebP variant — convert to q80 WebP (AWS.tsx convention). Impact: Medium. Effort: Low. (`src/pages/Foundation.tsx:3,49-54`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-D; 175 KB → 106 KB, orphaned JPEG removed)**
- [x] **[Accessibility]** The four focus areas are a `<div>` grid, not a semantic list — wrap in `<ul>`/`<li>`. Impact: Low. Effort: Low. (`src/pages/Foundation.tsx:149-166`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-E…J)**
- [x] **[Cleaner code]** Four near-identical CTA button blocks hand-duplicated — extract local button variants. Impact: Low. Effort: Low. (`src/pages/Foundation.tsx:71-86,220-235`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-E…J)**

### 5. The Vector Podcast
- [x] **[Cleaner code]** Episode dates render one day early for US visitors — `new Date('YYYY-MM-DD')` parses as UTC; make `formatDate` TZ-safe (cf. existing `formatMonthYear`). Impact: High. Effort: Low. (`src/utils/dateFormatter.ts:8`, `src/components/EpisodeCard.tsx:53,72,179`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-A)**
- [x] **[UX]** Featured "Now Playing" details card omits Spotify/Apple/YouTube listen links that every other card shows — add the link row. Impact: Medium. Effort: Low. (`src/pages/Podcast.tsx:169-187`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-E…J)**
- [x] **[Architecture]** EpisodeCard `topics`/`guests` sections are dead for production data (generator emits `topics: []`, never `guests`) — pick one source of truth. Impact: Medium. Effort: Medium. (`src/components/EpisodeCard.tsx:196,220`; `scripts/generate-podcast-episodes.js:261`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-E…J)**
- [x] **[Resilience & tests]** EpisodeCard date test uses a midday-UTC fixture that masks the date bug and never asserts the rendered date — use bare `YYYY-MM-DD` + assert under a fixed TZ. Impact: Medium. Effort: Low. (`src/components/EpisodeCard.test.tsx:11,22`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-A)**
- [x] **[Accessibility]** Compact episode accordion button has `aria-expanded` but no `aria-controls`/labelled region — add a panel id. Impact: Low. Effort: Low. (`src/components/EpisodeCard.tsx:24,66-67`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-E…J)**
- [x] **[Consistency]** `SpotifyFacade` iframe lacks the `sandbox` hardening `YouTubeFacade` applies (live-verify Spotify still plays). Impact: Low. Effort: Low. (`src/components/SpotifyFacade.tsx:13`, `src/components/YouTubeFacade.tsx:30`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-E…J)**

### 6. Beyond the Assessment
- [x] **[Performance]** Hero + reading images lack intrinsic width/height — CLS on a tracked metric; add `1500×1500` / `1131×1600` (Home pattern). Impact: High. Effort: Low. (`src/pages/BeyondTheAssessment.tsx:31-36,52-56`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-D)**
- [x] **[Architecture]** 2.1 MB unused source EPUB committed in `src/assets/` (56 XHTML files, never imported) — remove from repo. Impact: Low. Effort: Low. (`src/assets/Beyond the Assessment FINAL.epub/`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-E…J)**
- [x] **[Consistency]** CTA hover uses stock `amber-400` instead of `hover:bg-altivum-gold/90`. Impact: Low. Effort: Low. (`src/pages/BeyondTheAssessment.tsx:94`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-E…J)**
- [x] **[Accessibility]** CTA omits touch-target/press-feedback classes; arrow SVG lacks `aria-hidden`. Impact: Low. Effort: Low. (`src/pages/BeyondTheAssessment.tsx:89-100`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-E…J)**
- [x] **[Consistency]** Mixed straight/curly quotes & apostrophes in body copy — normalize to typographic glyphs. Impact: Low. Effort: Low. (`src/pages/BeyondTheAssessment.tsx:61,75,78,81`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-E…J)**

### 7. AWS
- [x] **[Accessibility]** Keyboard overlay buttons (static `projectTo2D`) float over the wrong spots because the canvas auto-rotates — remove the invisible overlay layer; the visible cluster nav bar is the real accessible control. Impact: Medium. Effort: Low. (`src/components/aws/InfraTopology.tsx:98-123`, `TopologyScene.tsx:162,250`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-E…J)**
- [x] **[Accessibility]** Overlay buttons are focusable children of an `aria-hidden="true"` wrapper with per-child `aria-hidden="false"` (unreliable anti-pattern) — resolved by removing the overlay. Impact: Medium. Effort: Low. (`src/components/aws/InfraTopology.tsx:99-108`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-E…J)**
- [x] **[Cleaner code]** `ClusterDetail.tsx` is dead code (162 lines, exported, never imported; pulls in drei `Html`) — delete. Impact: Medium. Effort: Low. (`src/components/aws/ClusterDetail.tsx:1,98`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-E…J)**
- [x] **[Cleaner code]** `flyTo` and `handleClusterClick` (and `reset`/`handleDeselect`) duplicate the camera-fly logic — extract `flyToCluster(id)`. Impact: Medium. Effort: Low. (`src/components/aws/TopologyScene.tsx:137,172`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-E…J)**
- [x] **[Performance]** Hero + Community Builder images lack dimensions (CLS); below-fold banner eager-loads — add width/height + `loading="lazy"`. Impact: Medium. Effort: Low. (`src/pages/AWS.tsx:35-40,50-54`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-D)**
- [x] **[Consistency]** Reduced-motion read via raw `window.matchMedia` (non-reactive) instead of `useMediaQuery`/`isMotionDisabled()`. Impact: Low. Effort: Low. (`src/components/aws/TopologyScene.tsx:58`, `ClusterEdge.tsx:15`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-E…J)**

### 8. Claude
- [x] **[Accessibility]** Keyboard-focused pipeline nodes have no visible focus indicator — inline `outline: 'none'` overrides the global gold focus-visible ring on the diagram's main control. Impact: High. Effort: Low. (`src/components/claude/PipelineNode.tsx:48,54`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-E…J)**
- [x] **[Consistency]** Architecture X-Ray shows stale guardrail config (Version "2") vs live `GUARDRAIL_VERSION = "5"` on a page marketed as production-real. Impact: Medium. Effort: Low. (`src/data/architectureNodes.ts:66`, `lambda/chat-stream/index.mjs:55`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-E…J)**
- [x] **[Accessibility]** Streaming response bubble re-announces on every chunk via `aria-live="polite"` — gate to the settled response. Impact: Medium. Effort: Low. (`src/components/claude/TraceResponseBubble.tsx:9-12`, `ArchitectureXRay.tsx:297,437`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-E…J)**
- [x] **[Consistency]** Motion gating uses raw `matchMedia` in two places instead of `isMotionDisabled()` (misses prerender flag). Impact: Low. Effort: Low. (`src/components/claude/ArchitectureXRay.tsx:122,196`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-E…J)**
- [x] **[Cleaner code]** Duplicate node-state builders (`buildInitialNodeStates`/`resetAllNodeStates` identical + a 3rd inline copy) and a redundant double `abort()`. Impact: Low. Effort: Low. (`src/components/claude/ArchitectureXRay.tsx:25-39,222,248`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-E…J)**

### 9. Links
- [x] **[Architecture]** `SOCIAL_LINKS` imported but bypassed for all but one entry — already caused live drift (`x.com/x_thechrisgrey` vs constant `x.com/thechrisgrey`). Reconcile the X URL, then source all from the constant. Impact: Medium. Effort: Low. (`src/pages/Links.tsx:43-44,5`; `src/constants/links.ts:9`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-E…J + X-handle reconcile): all links sourced from SOCIAL_LINKS + social cards deduped; owner confirmed canonical X handle = x.com/thechrisgrey, reconciled across Links.tsx + schemas.ts (Person sameAs)**
- [x] **[Consistency]** Contact CTA uses raw `<a href="/contact">` instead of `ViewTransitionLink`. Impact: Medium. Effort: Low. (`src/pages/Links.tsx:278-283`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-E…J)**
- [x] **[Cleaner code]** Personal & company social-card grids are byte-identical markup — extract a `SocialCard`/section helper. Impact: Low. Effort: Low. (`src/pages/Links.tsx:201-224,239-262`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-E…J)**
- [x] **[Performance]** Featured QR image has no width/height/loading/decoding (below fold) — add them (confirm intrinsic size). Impact: Low. Effort: Low. (`src/pages/Links.tsx:133-137`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-D)**

### 10. Contact & Speaking
- [x] **[Accessibility]** Field validation errors aren't associated with the input (one shared alert; no `aria-invalid`/`aria-describedby`/focus) — track per-field errors (reuse `FormInput` pattern). Impact: High. Effort: Medium. (`src/pages/Contact.tsx:55-66,264-326`; `src/components/ui/FormInput.tsx:41-49`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-C)**
- [x] **[Accessibility]** Inputs use `focus:outline-hidden`, suppressing the global gold focus-visible ring — drop it (mouse case already handled in CSS). Impact: Low. Effort: Low. (`src/pages/Contact.tsx:273,290,306,324`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-C)**
- [x] **[Accessibility]** Success-modal confirmation text isn't in a live region — add `role="status" aria-live="polite"`. Impact: Low. Effort: Low. (`src/pages/Contact.tsx:531-537`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-C)**
- [x] **[Cleaner code]** Dead `'success'` status branch — `formStatus` is never set to `'success'` (success path goes `'idle'` + modal). Impact: Low. Effort: Low. (`src/pages/Contact.tsx:20-23,344-352`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-C)**
- [x] **[Architecture]** Six near-identical contact-info link blocks (~75 lines) should be data-driven (siblings already `.map`). Impact: Low. Effort: Low. (`src/pages/Contact.tsx:391-468`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-C)**

### 11. Privacy Policy
- [x] **[Consistency]** "contact form" link is a raw `<a href>` (only raw internal anchor in `src/`) — use `ViewTransitionLink`. Impact: Medium. Effort: Low. (`src/pages/Privacy.tsx:306`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-E…J)**
- [x] **[Accessibility]** Manual `•` bullet spans are announced by AT — add `aria-hidden` or use native `list-disc marker`. Impact: Low. Effort: Low. (`src/pages/Privacy.tsx:71-72,104-105,198-199,226-227`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-E…J)**
- [x] **[UX]** "Reset analytics preference" button always renders, even with no consent on file — gate behind `isPostHogConfigured() && getConsent() === 'granted'`. Impact: Low. Effort: Low. (`src/pages/Privacy.tsx:182`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-E…J)**
- [x] **[Consistency]** Privacy is the only SEO page with no page-level `structuredData` — add `buildWebPageSchema`. Impact: Low. Effort: Low. (`src/pages/Privacy.tsx:17-25`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-E…J)**
- [ ] **[Cleaner code]** Consent reset forces a full `window.location.reload()` to re-show the banner — could re-show reactively (acceptable as-is for a rare control). Impact: Low. Effort: Medium. (`src/pages/Privacy.tsx:9-13`) — added 2026-06-15 — **deferred 2026-06-15 (WP-J): kept the full reload — acceptable for a rarely-used control per plan; reactive rewrite is out of refinement scope**

### 12. 404 / Not Found
- [x] **[Accessibility]** CTAs/quick-links miss the 48px touch-target + `touch-manipulation` convention. Impact: Medium. Effort: Low. (`src/pages/NotFound.tsx:41-61,69-85`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-E…J)**
- [x] **[Accessibility]** Decorative oversized `404` glyph is announced to screen readers — add `aria-hidden="true"`. Impact: Low. Effort: Low. (`src/pages/NotFound.tsx:18-28`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-E…J)**
- [x] **[Consistency]** Buttons use `transition-colors` only — missing `active:scale-[0.98]` press feedback and the gold CTA glow. Impact: Low. Effort: Low. (`src/pages/NotFound.tsx:43,50,57`) — added 2026-06-15 — **completed 2026-06-15 (WP-E…J)**
