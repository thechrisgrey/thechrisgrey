# Build performance tracking

The production build pipeline (`npm run build`) is measured, compared, and
budgeted so build-time regressions surface in CI instead of quietly
accumulating.

## How it works

| Piece                                                | Role                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `scripts/track-build-performance.mjs`                | Runs each pipeline step individually, times it, and emits a JSON report.                   |
| `scripts/compare-build-performance.mjs`              | Diffs the current report vs the previous CI run and vs the committed budgets.              |
| `build-performance-budgets.json`                     | Absolute per-step + total time ceilings (committed, deliberate targets).                   |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (`build-performance` job) | Runs the timed build, caches `node_modules/.vite`, uploads the report, writes the summary. |

Local usage:

```bash
npm run build:timed     # run the full pipeline with per-step timings
npm run build:compare   # compare a report against the previous run + budgets
```

The tracker prepends `node_modules/.bin` to `PATH`, so binary steps (`tsc`,
`vite build`) are measured correctly whether launched via `npm run` or directly
as `node scripts/track-build-performance.mjs` (how CI invokes it).

## Caching and optimization

- **Vite persistent cache** (`cacheDir: node_modules/.vite` in `vite.config.ts`)
  is restored in CI via `actions/cache`, keyed on `package-lock.json`.
- **npm dependency cache** via `actions/setup-node` (`cache: 'npm'`).
- **Code splitting** groups (router, vendor, sanity, cognito, three, gsap) are
  configured in `vite.config.ts` to keep chunks lean.

## Budgets

`build-performance-budgets.json` defines absolute ceilings per step and for the
total build. The compare step flags any step (or the total) that exceeds its
budget and exits non-zero, independent of whether a previous-run artifact exists
(artifacts expire after 90 days and are absent on the first run).

Budgets carry deliberate headroom over observed local timings because
network-bound steps (Sanity, YouTube) and the Puppeteer prerender vary run to
run. Raise a budget only when a step's cost grows for a justified reason, and
treat a raise as a conscious decision rather than a rubber stamp.

The `build-performance` CI job is non-blocking (`continue-on-error: true`): it
reports regressions and budget breaches in the run summary without gating
merges, so performance stays visible without becoming a flaky merge blocker.
